This is a modified version of [obsidian-spaced-repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) and merging [recall plugin](https://github.com/martin-jw/obsidian-recall) to use seperate json data file, and add some interesting features.

就是 SR 的时间排程信息可以单独保存，~~不修改原笔记文件内容~~(如果卡片复习，开启blockid设置，会在卡片文本后追加BlockID)，以及添加其他功能。
